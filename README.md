# LIVE-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
The "Live Image Classification with ESP32 and TFT using Edge Impulse" system
showcases the integration of IoT and machine learning for real-time image classification. Using the 
ESP32 microcontroller and a TFT display, it leverages Edge Impulse's platform to train and 
deploy lightweight machine learning models capable of identifying objects or patterns in images. The
Esp32 captures the live image and upon the button press it instantly displays the results on the TFT 
screen, offering a user-friendly interface.

Nowadays, IoT and embedded systems play a transformative role across industries by enabling 
automation, connectivity, and data-driven insights. They improve efficiency in manufacturing 
through predictive maintenance, enhance safety in healthcare with remote monitoring, and 
optimize logistics via real-time tracking. Thus, it highlights the potential of edge AI by 
combining cost-effective hardware with advanced machine learning techniques, making it ideal for 
applications such as security, automation, and environmental monitoring in resource-constrained 
environments.
